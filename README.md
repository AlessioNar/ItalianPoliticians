 Media Monitoring tool for Italian Politics
 
 In this repository I will upload my media monitoring tool for Italian Politics. For now, it contains an ordered database of the main features of Italian politicians and their screen name. I am currently in the process of building an app for analysing their tweets and identify their main topics. 
 
 Other steps concern an RSS monitoring system of the main Italian Outlets, and a functioning NLP workflow.
